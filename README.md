2.2 Installation Steps (H2)
2.2.1 Windows Installation (H3)
2.2.2 Mac Installation (H3)
3. Keep Formatting Consistent
Use the same font style, size, and capitalization across all headings.
Stick to a numbering system if the document is long or complex.
Make sure headings stand out visually (e.g., bold, larger font, or a different color).
4. Make Headings Scannable
Use keywords to help readers locate information quickly.
Keep subheadings brief and informative rather than overly detailed.
Use parallel structure (e.g., all headings start with a verb or noun phrase).
✅ Good Example:

Configuring the Database
Setting Up the Server
Deploying the Application
❌ Bad Example:

How to configure the database
Server setup instructions
Deployment details
5. Optimize for Searchability (SEO for Digital Documents)
Include keywords that readers might search for.
Use question-based headings if answering FAQs (e.g., “How Do I Reset My Password?”).
6. Avoid Overloading with Too Many Levels
Don’t overuse subheadings (3 levels deep is usually enough).
If a section becomes too long, break it into separate sections instead.
